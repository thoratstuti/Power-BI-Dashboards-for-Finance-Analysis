# Power-BI-Dashboards-for-Finance-Analysis
Power BI can group and gather information from multiple systems to present the whole picture of business data analytics in one “single view”. 
Among Power BI’s most powerful features is a dashboard, which employs visual representation methods to break down complex financial data into more understandable formats with an engaging style. Real-time charts and graphs generated from actual data will allow different departments in your company to use financial data more strategically; this implementation of financial alignment will bring together the board.
